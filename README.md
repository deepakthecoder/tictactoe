# tictactoe
It is a Tic tac toe game project in which HTML, CSS and Java-script languages are used. It is my first project and working fine but it still need some changes.
I want to use more CSS in this project to make it more visualy interesting and i am working on it.
working on last action of winning the game, it is showing alert first but i want to the game end first and then alert message.
